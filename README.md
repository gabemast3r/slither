# slither
a snake-like game for testing pygame

"PythonFiles" contains the code and sprites. Note that "slither.py" contains the game, while "setup.py" is only used for generating the game as executable (see "build"). Check out the tutorial, I used to learn pygame:

If you just want to play the game and you don't have Python or the pygame module installed, download "build" and run "slither.exe".
